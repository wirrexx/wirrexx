# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me! 

__Hi__ My name is Wisam Petros Odish, I am a father of **two** beautiful kids, my oldest one, a girl named Kiara and my youngest one, a boy named Keanu. 

I'm currently happy learning Python backend, although we are still on fundemamentals on how stuff work inside of Linux and the beautiful __Terminal__ it comes with. 

My goal at the end of my study, is simply to have at least 2 working projects, one intermediate and one advanced. 

As I have a background as a 3D artist in the game industry, I would love to create tools that artist can make use off! 

But my future goal is to use my newly learned coding skills and create Plugins for tools that i use (Automation), and maybe, just maybe, mobile game for kids. 

During my freetime, you will find me in the gym, watching sports, playing games or enjoying my time with my kids and fianceÃ©!
