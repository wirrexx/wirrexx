### About me!

--
__Hi__ My name is Wisam Petros Odish, I am a father of **two** beautiful kids, my oldest one, a girl named Kiara and my youngest one, a boy named Keanu. 

I'v currently finished up my Python backend developer at DCI.
My background is in 3D art and Level Design for Mobile and Console/PC Games.

As I mentioned with my background as a 3D artist in the game industry, I would love to create tools that artist can make use off! Here are some of the stuff I am allowed to show from my experience [Portfolio](https://www.artstation.com/wirrexx/albums/all).

But with my newly learned coding skills I am going to take the opportunity to create Plugins for the tools that i daily use (Automation). 

During my **freetime**, you will find me in the gym, watching sports, playing games or ***spending my time with my kids and fiancÃ©e!***

Who are you?

Someone that wants to evolve just like me. 

Someone who is willing to grow continuily.

Proper ticket based work, scrum or something similiar!

Nice to have:

Self education time on company Time!
